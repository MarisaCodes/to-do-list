# to-do-list

___

This is a very basic to do list web app. You can add todos and delet them. You can edit them as well.

I had a lot of fun with this one as I sat all day just focused on finishing it.

# Extra features (let a beginner brag please):

- The text that's already in the todo gets transfered to the edit box! So you can basically undo the edit by clicking enter or Edit!

- You cannot add empty todos! (this was an actual bug lmao)

- You cannot add infinite edit boxes!
